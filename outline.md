### End Goal

Build a full-stack application with Node and Express where the user can authenticate via Twitter. Once authenticated, the user is then displayed some nice charts and graphs populated with data from the Twitter API.

### Example Code

Make sure to create a new directory on your machine called "node-workshop" to house all of your projects for these workshops. Each individual assignment should be placed within that directory. Make sure to add a git repo to each directory.
