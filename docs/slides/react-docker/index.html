## Why Docker?

*Often, when developing applications with a microservice architecture, you cannot fully test out all services until you deploy to a staging server. This takes much too long to get feedback. Docker helps to speed up this process by making it easier to link together small, independent services locally.*

In this talk, we'll look at a development workflow to manage a React app running in a Docker container within a larger set of services.

Want to see some bigger examples?

### Development Workflow (part 1)

Add a *Dockerfile* to the project root...

```yaml
FROM node:latest

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# add `/usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install and cache app dependencies
ADD package.json /usr/src/app/package.json
RUN npm install
RUN npm install react-scripts@0.9.5 -g

# add app
ADD . /usr/src/app

# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

--

Be sure to take advantage of Docker's layered cache system, to speed up build times, by adding the *package.json* and installing the dependencies **before** adding the app's source files. For more on this, check out [Building Efficient Dockerfiles - Node.js](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/).

---

### Development Workflow (part 1, continued...)

Build the image, and then spin up the container in [detached](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d) mode:

```sh
$ docker build -t "react-denver"
$ docker run -d -p 3333:3000 react-denver
```

--

Once spun up, the app will be available on port `3333` on the host machine and on port `3000` for other Docker services.

--

Test - [localhost:3333](localhost:3333)

--

Other commands:

1. `docker ps` - view currenly running docker process
1. `docker images` view built images
1. `docker help` - sweet goodness!

---

### Development Workflow (part 2)


Simplify with Docker Compose

---

### Development Workflow (part 3)


Coding workflow

---

### Staging Workflow (part 1)

Create build

---

### Staging Workflow (part 2)

Add environment varibles

---

## Next Steps

That's it! What's next?

1. Add some stuff!
