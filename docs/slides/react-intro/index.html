## Objectives

By the end of this talk you should be able to:

1. Work with React running inside a Docker Container
1. Simply your development workflow with Docker Compose
1. Pass environment variables to a Docker image at build time
1. Utilize volumes to mount your code into a container
1. Do something
1. Add something

---

## Why Docker?

*Often, when developing applications with a microservice architecture, you cannot fully test out all services until you deploy to a staging server. This takes much too long to get feedback. Docker helps to speed up this process by making it easier to link together small, independent services locally.*

--

In this talk, we'll look at a development workflow to manage a React app running in a Docker container within a larger set of services.

---

### Development Workflow (part 1)

Add a *Dockerfile* to the project root:

```yaml
FROM node:latest

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# add `/usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install and cache app dependencies
ADD package.json /usr/src/app/package.json
RUN npm install
RUN npm install react-scripts@0.9.5 -g

# add app
ADD . /usr/src/app

# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

--

Be sure to take advantage of Docker's layered cache system, to speed up build times, by adding the *package.json* and installing the dependencies **before** adding the app's source files. For more on this, check out [Building Efficient Dockerfiles - Node.js](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/).

---

### Development Workflow (part 1, continued...)

Build the image, and then spin up the container in [detached](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d) mode:

```sh
$ docker build -t "react-denver"
$ docker run -d -p 3333:3000 react-denver
```

--

Once spun up, the app will be available on port `3333` on the host machine and on port `3000` for other Docker services.

--

Test - [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

--

Other commands:

1. `docker ps` - view currenly running docker process
1. `docker images` view built images
1. `docker help` - sweet goodness!

---

### Development Workflow (part 2)


Simplify your workflow with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Add a *docker-compose.yml* file to the project root:

```yaml
version: "2.1"

services:

  react-service:
    container_name: react-service
    build: ./
    ports:
      - '3337:3000' # expose ports - HOST:CONTAINER
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
```

--

Running a number of microservices locally each within a different project repo? Docker Compose helps to link them together, making it feel almost as easy as running a monolith with a single run command:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

--

Test - [http://localhost:3337](http://localhost:3337)

---

### Development Workflow (part 3)

Add a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) instruction to the Compose file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - './:/usr/src/app'
  - '/usr/src/app/node_modules'
```

--

Volumes are used to mount a directory inside a container so that you can make modifications to the code *without* having to rebuild the image. This should be a default in your local development environment so you quickly get feedback on code changes.

--

To prevent the volume - `/usr/src/app` - from overriding the *node_modules*, we used a data volume - `/usr/src/app/node_modules`. This may or may not be necessary, depending on the order in which you set up your image and containers. Check out [Getting npm packages to be installed with docker-compose](http://dchua.com/2016/02/07/getting-npm-packages-to-be-installed-with-docker-compose/) for more.

--

Update the container:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

--

Test auto reload! Make a change to the code and watch it update in the browser...

---

### Development Workflow (part 4)

You can dynamically add [environment variables](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables) to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) by prefixing them with `REACT_APP_`.

--

Add a `console.log` to the *App.js*:

```javascript
console.log(process.env)
```

--

Add the variable to your compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=development
  - REACT_APP_TEST=yoyo
```

--

Update the container:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

--

Wait. This added the variables at run time. What issues will we have if we create a build?

---


### Staging Workflow (part 1)

Since env variables are added during the build, we need to make some changes. Add a *Dockerfile-stage* to the project root:

```yaml
FROM node:latest

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# add `/usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# add environment variables
ARG REACT_APP_TEST
ENV REACT_APP_TEST=$REACT_APP_TEST

# install and cache app dependencies
ADD package.json /usr/src/app/package.json
RUN npm install && npm install pushstate-server -g

# add app
ADD . /usr/src/app

# build react app
RUN npm run build

# start app
CMD ["pushstate-server", "build"]
```

---

### Staging Workflow (part 1, continued...)

Add a *docker-compose-stage.yml* file to the project root:

```yaml
version: "2.1"

services:

  react-service:
    container_name: react-service-stage
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-stage
      args:
        - REACT_APP_TEST=yoyo
    ports:
      - '3337:9000' # expose ports - HOST:CONTAINER
```

--

So-

- `args` are added during the Docker image build, which we grab (`ARG REACT_APP_TEST`) and then set as an env variable (`ENV REACT_APP_TEST=$REACT_APP_TEST`)

--

Wait. Why did we remove the volume?

---

### Staging Workflow (part 1, continued...)

Remove the `console log` and add the following to the `render()`:

```javascript
<p>{process.env.REACT_APP_TEST}</p>
```

--

Bring down the dev container:

```sh
$ docker-compose down
```

--

Build the image and spin up the staging container:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-stage.yml up -d --build
```
--

Test - [http://localhost:3337](http://localhost:3337)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/react-heart.svg" alt="react logo with a heart" style="width:40px">
</div>

---

### Staging Workflow (part 2)

What else would you like to see?

1. Change build context to GitHub repo
1. Deploy to EC2 and/or Digital Ocean
1. Debugging dev app with Docker Logs
1. Dance, Dance, Dance!

---

## Next Steps

That's it! What's next?

1. Add some stuff!
1. Add some more stuff!
1. Add like even more freaking stuff, you know?
