# Redux Intro

## Topics

1. foo
1. bar

## Principles

1. **Single source of truth**: The *state* of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single *store*.
1. **State is read-only**: The only way to change the state is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.
1. **Changes are made with pure functions**: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure *reducers*.
