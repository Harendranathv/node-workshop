# Outline

v0.0.1

### End Goal

Build a full-stack application with Node, Express, Postgres React, and Redux.

### Example Code

Make sure to create a new directory on your machine called "node-workshop" to house all of your projects for these workshops. Each individual assignment should be placed within that directory. Make sure to add a git repo to each directory.
